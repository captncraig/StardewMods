This mod makes your TV much more useful. Sunday episodes of "The Queen of Sauce" will now be recorded, and on Wednesdays you will prefer episodes
that you have not seen yet, instead of random ones. This makes it much easier to catch up if you miss a few Sunday episodes.


There is also a new fishing channel that airs daily: "The Big One"! This handy guide will help you know where to go to catch fish.
It will automatically show you fish you need for the community center or collection achievements. It tells you where to go and when. It automatically accounts for the current day's
season and weather, as well as your fishing level, fish difficulty, and your current achievement status, to prioritize what fish you should try for next. 
You can watch it over and over again to learn about more fish, but it will only show you fish you can catch today.
