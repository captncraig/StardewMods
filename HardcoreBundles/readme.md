### What This Mod does (High Level)

- By default, all bundles are vanilla.
- Book added to community center that lets you activate "Hardcore" mode.
- Once activated all bundles become availible. And Very hard.
- Seriously harder. Designed to take 5-10 years. Perfect for multiplayer, or games with imbalanced mods (automate, larger farm maps or greenhouses, etc..)
- Area completion rewards (greenhouse and stuff) are purchasable from the book in community center. Prices are double the joja prices.
- On actually completing a full room, you will not get the standard rewards. Instead you get a stardrop or iridium milk in mail. (maybe in the future I'll get more ideas for new larger rewards)
- Each bundle activates a special perk when completed. These are often very significant.


### More changes

- (TODO) All items needed for Overachiever's bundle are not obtainable in vanilla game. They are discoverable through various achievements or added other ways. Secret notes are added to help you find them.
- Many special perks implemented. May imbalance game greatly.
- (TODO) Wizard quest at railroad unlocked at 10 hearts with wizard. 
- (TODO) Pam's house upgrade unlocked at 10 hearts w/ Pam and 8+ with Penny.
